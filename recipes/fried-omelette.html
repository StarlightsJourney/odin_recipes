<h2>Description</h2>

<p><strong> Egg foo young </strong>is essentially a flavoured and filled <i>Chinese omelette</i>,
    smothered in a delicious gravy-like sauce.
    It’s light, fluffy and comes together very quickly,
    so is perfect for rustling up when you don’t feel like flexing your cooking muscles too much.</p>

<p> Try this as part of a banquet, with rice, crispy cereal prawns and a spicy sambal sotong.</p>

<h3> Ingredients </h3>
<ul>
    <li> 6 eggs </li>
    <li> 1 tsp cornflour </li>
    <li> 1tsp vegetables oil </li>
    <li> 200g peeled prawns </li>
    <li> 2 spring onions, sliced </li>
</ul>

<h4> Sauce </h4>
<ul>
    <li> 1/4 cup chicken stock </li>
    <li> 1/4 cup oyster sauce </li>
    <li> 1 tbsp soy sauce </li>
    <li> 1 tbsp Chinese Shaoxing wine </li>
    <li> 1 tsp cornflour (cornstarch), mixed with 1 tsp water </li>
    <li> 1 tsp sesame oil </li>
</ul>

<h3> Steps </h3>
<ol>
    <li> For the sauce, combine the chicken stock, oyster sauce, soy sauce and Shaoxing wine in a small saucepan over high heat. </li>
    <li> Simmer for 2 minutes. </li>
    <li> Stir through the cornflour mixture, then simmer for another minute until the sauce has slightly thickened. </li>
    <li> Turn the heat off and stir through the sesame oil. Remove pan from heat and set aside for later. </li>
    <li> Whisk the eggs with the cornflour and 1 teaspoon of the vegetable oil. </li>
    <li> Heat a non-stick frying pan or wok over high heat. Add the prawns and stir-fry for 2 minutes or until just cooked. </li>
    <li> Then pour in the extra 3 tablespoons of oil. Wait a few seconds for the oil to heat up, then pour in the egg mixture. </li>
    <li> The egg should start to set and puff at the edges immediately. Once the egg is almost set in the middle, sprinkle over the spring onion.</li>
    <li> Then flip half the omelette over onto the other half. Cook until just set. </li>
    <li> Scoop out chunks of the omelette onto a serving plate. </li>
    <li> Reheat the sauce (add a little water if it is too thick) and pour over the omelette. Serve immediately. </li>
</ol>
